# Cracking-App-File
This project provides a framework for analyzing and cracking application files by deassembling executable files into assembly code. The primary purpose is to extract critical information from the assembly code, enabling users to create a verification file that can be utilized to crack the app.

## Features

- **Deassemble Executables:** Break down `.exe` files into their assembly language components.
- **Analyze Assembly Code:** Identify key segments of the code that define cracking requirements.
- **Generate Verification Files:** Automatically create text files containing data needed for app verification and cracking.
- **Flexible Framework:** Adaptable to various disassembly and cracking scenarios, offering a robust solution for reverse engineering tasks.
